New files:

1) thread.c -
- It has implementation of thread_create, thread_join, thread_exit
- Both spinlocks and mutex are implemented in this same file. By default mutex works here.
 	* In order to test spinlocks, please uncomment the spinlock function calls (line: 73,78,99) 
 	  and comment the mutex function calls (line: 74,79,100).
- Run it in xv6 by typing this - thread

2) thread_cv.c -
- Conditional variables with Mutex is implemented here. A small queue is used to test the solution.
- Run it in xv6 by typing this - thread_cv
